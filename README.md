> To run the project:
> 1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
> 2. Start locally: `npm run dev`
> 3. Optional: install `lovable-tagger` for component tagging during development

The PostCSS configuration will use `@tailwindcss/postcss` when available and fall back to `tailwindcss` otherwise, so either plugin works out of the box.


It is also necessary to install the folder with audio of all the Ayats from the Quran from the link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hu18XEnVbGfjLoI6yiVXtbs9-onQcnh2/view?usp=sharing

**This site is created for peaceful and thoughtful Qur'an reading with maximum comfort and atmosphere.**
